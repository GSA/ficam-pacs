This _Physical Access Control System (PACS) Guide_ will help you understand concepts related to _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management_-compliant PACSs and Enterprise Physical Access Control Systems (E-PACSs). 

The following is a high-level look at the difference between a PACS and an E-PACS:
* A **PACS** is a *standalone* system that controls physical access at one federal agency site by authenticating employees and contractors
* An **E-PACS** extends the concept of a PACS to instead act as a unified, *enterprise-wide* system that controls physical access at most (or all) sites that belong to an agency.
