During the last 10 years, the Federal government and the smart card, access control, and other interested industries have been developing a set of identity-based cryptographic tokens that can be registered, monitored, and authenticated across an enterprise. Innovations in identity vetting and issuance now enable you to implement a risk-based access control system that can validate a token and establish trust in a person or device.

## PACS Playbook

This Playbook is for access control system architects, implementers, and project managers.  It provides you with the planning guidance you need to implement physical access control systems that work with Personal Identify Verification cards (PIV-PACS) and that conform to NIST and GSA requirements.  

This playbook help you with the following:

* Determining facility risk
* Selecting the appropriate PIV mechanism to use for authentication
* Understanding enterprise PACS and security functions
* Recognizing PIV and PIV-I considerations
* Procuring FIPS 201-approved products and services
* Deploying a PIV-PACS
