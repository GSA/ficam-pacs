Thank you for considering contributing to our development of open and transparent PACS Guides.  Everyone has tricks and tips and we want to share these with our colleagues! 

To contribute to this site, you can:

- [Open an issue](#open-an-issue)
- [Edit an existing page](#edit-an-existing-page)
- [Add a new page](#add-a-new-page)
- [Notes on using this repository](#notes-on-using-this-repository)

Using GitHub as a first time user can be overwhelming.  An introduction video is available from DigitalGov on YouTube: [Introduction to GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNa9GOtM6NE&t=1737s){:target="blank"}.  


## Open an issue

Issues are the primary way to share information and discuss this site with the broader community. You can use issues for:

* _Suggestions:_ You want to suggest an edit or addition to existing information on this site.
* _Corrections:_ You identified a problem with existing information on the site and want to discuss a correction.

To submit an issue, click **Submit Issues Here** in the left navigation bar. 

For a quick guide on opening issues, read [how to open issues.]({{site.baseurl}}/openissue/){:target="_blank"}

## Edit an existing page

You can submit direct changes and line edits to the content. Click **Edit this page** in the upper right corner of the page you want to modify.  You don't need to install any software to submit content; you can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit the changes for discussion. 

For a quick guide on editing a page, read [how to edit a page.]({{site.baseurl}}/editpage/){:target="_blank"}

## Add a new page
We welcome new pages and appreciate your contributions!  

First, propose a topic by [opening an issue]({{site.baseurl}}/contribute/#open-an-issue){:target="blank"}.  If you don't have a topic, a good place to start is by reviewing the existing **Issues** lists. 

* [PIV Guides Issues](https://github.com/GSA/piv-guides/issues){:target="blank"}.
* [Federal PKI Guides Issues](https://github.com/GSA/fpki-guides/issues){:target="blank"}.
* [FICAM Architecture Issues](https://github.com/GSA/ficam-arch/issues){:target="blank"}.

Choose one of the issues and start a conversation on the issue. By creating or discussing an issue, you can clarify the problem, identify the solution, and propose a format for the new page. When you're ready, post a comment on the issue that you want to write the solution!  We will create a new **branch** for you if needed.

For a quick guide on adding a page, read [how to add a page.]({{site.baseurl}}/addpage/){:target="_blank"}

We have a [sample template with markdown samples]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/pages/template.md){:target="blank"}.

## Notes on using this repository

In the [GitHub repository]({{site.repo_url}}){:target="_blank"}, on the **Code** tab, you can view the folder structure of this website:

The following folders contain the content and diagrams:

*  _pages_: includes the Introduction, Identifiers, Getting Started, and Certificate Trust pages.
* _img_: includes all diagrams and images, which are available for download and reuse anywhere.

We encourage you to read our [LICENSE]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/LICENSE.md){:target="_blank"} and our [README]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/README.md){:target="_blank"}, which exist within this repository.  

###  General Practices

This content is vendor-neutral. You should not submit marketing materials for commercial products. If you want to contribute a page or content that includes commercial products and specific references for development and engineering, please review the commercial product trademark or copyright guides from the product vendor and reference those guides in your pull request.  

### Plain Language

Consider the audience when you submit content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

  * Make each page brief.
  * Use titles to help the user identify jump-off points for information.
  * Write short paragraphs. 
  * Write in plain language and active voice as much as possible.
  * Use numbered steps, bullet lists, and graphics.

The following sources can provide additional help with plain language, writing, and style:

  * [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}
  * [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/){:target="_blank"}
