## What Training Is Required?

The team responsible for the PACS design, procurement, deployment, testing, and maintenance may include both agency employees and contract personnel.  The mix will vary depending on the scope of the project, but the team as a whole must have a wide range of knowledge and experience.  Some training will be general, but most training must be tailored to agency policies, facility procedures, and the system being installed.

### Administrator Training

A PACS is now considered part of the federal IT infrastructure.  System administration is often divided between agency IT support personnel and application administrators, who are trained by individual PACS manufacturers. Application administrators are responsible for configuring doors, card readers, locks, alarms, events, and schedules within the PACS application. Some administrator tasks, such as back-ups, disaster recovery, and auditing can be performed by either IT support personnel or application administrators, depending on your agency’s policy.

* IT support personnel need knowledge and experience in network communication, account management, and information security. 
* Application administrators must understand how to configure the PACS to operate in accordance with your agency’s policies and operational procedures.  

### Operator Training

PACS operators can manage credentials or access privileges, monitor alarms and events, and respond to them.  PACS operator training should be tailored to your agency’s policies and procedures, the individual’s role within your agency, and your facility’s PACS configuration.

### Technician Training

PACS technicians install and wire the system controllers, readers, and door hardware.  Technicians may also be PACS application administrators.  Technicians require knowledge and experience with basic low-voltage wiring techniques, device communication and supervision, and specific PACS controller architecture.  They must also be trained to monitor system performance to identify and resolve potential problems before the problems affect operations.

## Where Can I Get Training?

### Equipment Manufacturers  

Most system manufacturers offer product-specific administrator, operator, and technician courses. Training may be in a classroom or web-based; in many cases, individuals completing this training receive a manufacturer’s certification. Manufacturer training may not address unique operational procedures or facility-specific configurations, so authorized service providers may also conduct this training.  Training must remain current since hardware, software, and firmware change periodically.

### Authorized Service Providers  

Many authorized service providers train agency operators and technicians as part of their contract to install, configure, and maintain the PACS.  This training should be tailored to your agency and facility, focusing on the features that have been implemented, ignoring unused features, and showing how the system is configured to complement your operational policies and procedures.

### Industry Certifications

Industry certifications are neither product nor policy specific.  They generally require a combination of experience, training, and examinations to demonstrate competence.  Many certifications also require continuing education.  The individual courses required for these certifications often serve as a good source of general training, even if the entire program is not completed.  Available certifications include, but are not limited to:

* The Secure Technology Alliance offers [four training programs](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-education-and-certification-programs/){:target="_blank"}.<!--STA linked page shows **4** training options.--> The Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) program trains individuals responsible for implementing FIPS-201 compliant systems. The Certified Smart Card Industry Professional/Government (CSCIP/G) program trains individuals with experience implementing smart card technologies.

* ASIS International offers the [Certified Protection Professional (CPP) program](https://www.asisonline.org/certify){:target="_blank"}, for individuals who manage security programs, and the Physical Security Professional (PSP) program, for individuals who design and implement physical protection systems.

* The Security Industry Association (SIA) offers the [Certified Security Project Manager (CSPM) program](https://www.securityindustry.org/professional-development/cspm-certification/){:target="_blank"} for individuals who manage complex technical security projects. Some equipment manufacturers require CSPM certification.

* The [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/){:target="_blank"} and [(ISC)<sup>2</sup>](https://www.isc2.org/Training){:target="_blank"} both offer cybersecurity related courses and certifications.
