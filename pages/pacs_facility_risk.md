title: Determine Facility Risk
permalink: /facilityrisk/
---

The risk to facilities and security areas within facilities is generally driven by the sensitivity of the assets (databases, equipment, and people). Risk is reduced when critical assets can only be accessed by individuals who demonstrate a valid need for access and who can prove that they are who they claim to be.

To determine facility risk:

* Identify potential threats to critical assets.
* Determine how likely it is that a particular threat will occur.
* Identify the impact if an asset is harmed in some way (damaged, destroyed, stolen, or compromised). Impact can be, for example, financial loss, sensitive data loss, or a security breach.

NIST SP 800-116, _A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in Physical Access Control (PACS)_ (http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-116.pdf{:target="_blank"}), recommends the risk-based approach to managing physical access to Federal government facilities and assets.  NIST SP800-116 also allows you to tailor your PIV-PACS implementation to your internal physical access control policies, practices, and procedures. 
The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) also publishes policies, standards, and best practices (https://www.dhs.gov/isc-policies-standards-best-practices).  These standards can also be helpful:
They establish criteria and define the process for determining a facility security level.
They represent a single source of physical security countermeasures for all Federal facilities.
They offer guidance for customizing facility countermeasures and integrating new standards and concepts. 

## Selecting the Appropriate Authentication Mechanism 

In order to determine how many factors of authentication are required, a risk analysis should be conducted for each access point (door). The diagram below outlines the multi-step process for selecting which mechanism to use for authentication.  At a minimum, the process includes four steps:
