This work is in early Alpha stage and is led by the GSA FICAM Program, in coordination with the ICAM Subcommittee of the Federal CIO Council and members of the Secure Technology Alliance Access Control Council.

(Additional repositories are under development for community contributors to share ICAM implementation guides, code, reference implementations, and solutions.)

# Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)
This repository is for the collaborative development of the implementation guidance for FICAM PACS. The content supports the creation and future versions of "Modernizing PACS Infrastructure," previously found in the <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/FICAM_Roadmap_and_Implem_Guid.pdf" target="_blank">_FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0_, Section 7</a>.

## Collaboration Overview

1. Federal agencies would like an updated Physical Access Control System (PACS) implementation guide to: 

* Replace the FICAM Roadmap’s “Modernize PACS Infrastructure” section, as part of its deprecation process 
* Understand enterprise physical access control systems
* Align Facility Security Level (FSL) and authentication
* Procure a physical access control systems 
* Identify recommended training

2. The existing draft in this repository was submitted by the Access Control Council of the Secure Technology Alliance and used a white paper model.

* It needs to become a digital Playbook.  
* It needs to incorporate standard operating procedures and lessons learned from federal agencies.

## Required Actions

GSA, federal agencies, and industry contributors will collaboratively revise the Playbook draft to meet the above objectives. Guidelines for content revisions are:

* Digital friendly navigation (logical structure) to help the user find information quickly 
* Content compliance with current government policies, standards, regulations, and practices
* Unnecessary content is eliminated
* Any subjective material is removed--all information shall be objective
* Short sentences, bullets, and checklists are used
* Mobile-friendly, updated graphics are used based on the _FICAM Architecture or other government graphics_  
* Pain language and active voice 
* Acronyms are removed where not needed  
* Referenced documents are verified and do not included deprecated policy, standards, or best practices 

## Expected Outcomes

* A clear, cohesive, user-friendly Playbook that will give federal agencies the information needed to understand, manage, procure, and deploy an enterprise physical access control system that complies with government policies, standards, regulations, and practices.

* Should be understandable by Program Managers and Engineers.
